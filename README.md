# **Running ZAP in a Robot Framework**

-----------------------

## What is this repository for ?

* Resources files that allows run Security tests using OWASP ZAP (https://www.owasp.org/) in Robot Framework Automation test

-----------------------

## How do I get set up?
### Is needed some depending libraries, that can be installed, through pip:

The OWASP ZAP must be installed in server where the test should run,


The ZAP api can be downloaded from PyPI (download link in The ZAP API page) or it can be installed using:

    pip install python-owasp-zap-v2.4


### Download these files and run this command:

    python setup.py install

-----------------------
### Robot variables that should be adjusted for test

* These variables should be used to the project context.

| Variables  |Example |Information   |
|---|---|---|
| @{risk_alerts}  | ``` Medium     High ```| Risk list alert, can be configured by adding or remove alerts from this set _[Low,Medium,High]_, donÂ´t forget the python tabulation between each risk alert  |
| ${ZAP_HOST}  |  localhost | Host where the ZAP will retrive all Request and Responses|
| ${ZAP_PORT}  |  9090 |Host PORT for ZAP|
| ${ZAP_PATH}  | (WIN) C:\\OWASP\\ZedAttackProxy   | Directory where the zap executable is placed.|
| ${ZAP_REPORT_PATH}|    C:\\testing\\RF_ZAP\\rf\\ZAPlogs |Directory where the zap logs are placed.
| ${API_KEY}    |  ${EMPTY} | API key is required by default in order to invoke any of the API operations. This is a security feature to prevent malicious sites from invoking the ZAP API. Can be retrieved/removed in OWASP ZAP bym accessing *Tools> API*.


### Robot Keywords that can be used:
| Keyword  |Argument/Return |    |

|Start Headless ZAP||Start OWASP ZAP without GUI|
|Create New Session ZAP||Creates a new session|
|Perform URL Active Scan| *[Arguments]*: URL|Runs the active scanner against the given URL|
|Get Zap Alerts| *[Arguments]*: URL *[Return]*:Alert list|Returns in JSON format, all alerts raised by ZAP, filtered by URL|
|Get Zap Alert Total| *[Arguments]*: URL *[Return]*:Alert quantity |Returns as integer quantity of alerts raised by ZAP|

|Set Firefox proxy|*[Arguments]*:Host, Port| Configure a Firefox profile to be able to run a Firefox Browser instance that allows  redirect all Request and Reponses to ZAP application to the Host:Port
|Set Chorme proxy|*[Arguments]*:Host, Port| Configure a Chrome browser to be able to run a Browser instance that allows  redirect all Request and Reponses to ZAP application to the Host:Port


### Usage

#### To perform security usually is needed follow these step:
* Start Headless ZAP
* Open a Browser that redirect all request to the ZAP proxy to the site to be run ZAP security test;
* Navigate the web application until reach the step that want to test: Page, Field, Form...
* Create a ZAP new session
* Perform a successful test
* Perform URL Active Scan
* Get Zap Alerts
* Run the ZAP alert

#### Here is an example in Robot Framework of how to use this Resource, to test security issue in a Form:
```python
Start Headless      ZAP
Open URL in Firefox with ZAP proxy    ${URL}
Wait Until Element Is Visible    ${urlLogo}
Login in Page
Go to Form
Create New Session ZAP
Input text      ${form}     admin
Perform URL Active Scan 		${URL}
@{ALERTS}=    	Get Zap Alerts   ${URL}
Shutdown ZAP
```
